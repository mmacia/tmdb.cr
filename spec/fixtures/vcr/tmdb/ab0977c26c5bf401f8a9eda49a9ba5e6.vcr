Through fragments of memory, confession, and quiet observation, the film unravels the inner battles waged in solitude—the sleepless nights, the weight of expectations, and the silent pain of repeated failures and small triumphs.  As I chart my own journey through this unforgiving landscape, the film becomes more than just a chronicle of preparation. It is an intimate exploration of how these examinations, with all their pressures and promises, reshaped my understanding of hard work, success, and the fleeting nature of this world.  Metamorphosis is not merely about reaching a goal—it is about the transformation that occurs in pursuit of one. It is about the boy who entered this race, and the person who emerged from it, forever changed.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/zOBr4iwbYXAbEqDl0XGpC3NX9Ai.jpg","release_date":"2025-12-26","title":"METAMORPHOSIS","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/6AEkj2Yaa9BIuJHEAaTBm4YLQ2I.jpg","genre_ids":[35,27,10770],"id":1591705,"original_language":"fr","original_title":"Noël mortel à Groland","overview":"When the Groland teams take on the concept of Christmas, it's a safe bet that there will be dark humor under the tree and tasty sketches as the main course.","popularity":0.0604,"poster_path":"/wsyYMi87c9qWeQgv9kks3r9BSIq.jpg","release_date":"2025-12-13","title":"Deadly Christmas in Groland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/td7PBAiRiJiB5yMOaofDULz0GwW.jpg","genre_ids":[18,53],"id":1590915,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Presentable Liberty","overview":"A prisoner is locked away in a lonely cell as part of a state-of-the-art program for prisoners all over the nation, operated by the notorious Doctor Money, due to a recent deadly virus spreading throughout the world.
