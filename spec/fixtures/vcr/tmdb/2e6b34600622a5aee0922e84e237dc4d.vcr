Starting from the director's mother's written records and childhood images in which her presence appears only in fragments — a hand holding, an arm supporting, a shadow on the edge — the film proposes a reflection on absence and the traces left in the visual narratives of family life.  By weaving together facts and fabrication, the work reveals how family albums function not only as repositories of memory, but also as coming-of-age stories, full of choices, silences, and inventions. Between delicacy and humor, the film questions who appears and who is erased in these stories, exploring the invisibility of care work and its discreet permanence in the materiality of photography.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/k23TKa5QDjDepzgKk389mPsRpZj.jpg","release_date":"2025-12-12","title":"Álbum do Bebê","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[],"id":1594525,"original_language":"es","original_title":"Todos los nombres de mis amigos","overview":"","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/66UKXrDDKSHMkePmTO67dST7Nno.jpg","release_date":"2025-12-10","title":"Todos los nombres de mis amigos","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[99],"id":1594413,"original_language":"es","original_title":"Tunun","overview":"Documentary that shows the struggle of the indigenous community of Cosquín-Las Tunas against the Punilla Highway, planned without their consent.
