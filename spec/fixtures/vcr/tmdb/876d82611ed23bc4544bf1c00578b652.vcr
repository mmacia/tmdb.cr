Four images of dancer Cheryl Nayowitz move past and through images of Israel and words spoken by the Holon Scratch Orchestra, along with music by the ensemble Gray Code. The film and its music are anchored by the song “Sachki Sachki,” sung by Vered Forbes.  The film has no story, dialogue, or characters (other than the dancer). While there is text in Hebrew and English, you don’t need to know either language to enjoy the film. The English is a dreamlike text scrambled to approximate what you might hear while falling asleep. The Hebrew words which are heard and seen onscreen during much of the film are streams of consciousness, improvised by women’s voices on the themes of segments of the film. When we hear the song “Sachki Sachki,” the words appear onscreen both in the original Hebrew and in an English translation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"release_date":"2025-12-14","title":"dreamtext","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/5xBjomk4EWnV58eFnR8N0u3DHXe.jpg","genre_ids":[35],"id":1595047,"original_language":"es","original_title":"El Rincón de LonkPlays: YOUTUBEMAGEDÓN","overview":"","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/jZp2sKe5uFThhEzOenIZCuzTD8A.jpg","release_date":"2025-12-10","title":"El Rincón de LonkPlays: YOUTUBEMAGEDÓN","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[35],"id":1595032,"original_language":"fr","original_title":"Ibiza Cocktail","overview":"","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/q2KIDic1ovMc69nD9cbN7xNwEwJ.jpg","release_date":"2025-12-11","title":"Ibiza Cocktail","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/eqXig1ALIyFChuNOWUF0BE2b8VH.jpg","genre_ids":[27,18],"id":1594900,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Everything Hurts","overview":"A dysfunctional group of friends find their lives upturned when they become immersed in a computer simulation of their recently deceased friend.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/7tbIqxQhzRlJ0qJF1n5CFqzIQ0A.jpg","release_date":"2025-12-11","title":"Everything Hurts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[],"id":1594865,"original_language":"vi","original_title":"Chân Trời Rực Rỡ","overview":"A music documentary from Hà Anh Tuấn.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lAkQUxMPG0fOxEq6KRiKzO4P5aB.jpg","release_date":"2025-12-12","title":"The Glorious Horizon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[],"id":1594857,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Sholay: The Final Cut","overview":"After his family is murdered by the notorious bandit Gabbar Singh, a former police officer enlists the services of two outlaws to capture him and seek revenge.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/9wcES7d0Zz3r6579zLXYBHiJdzk.jpg","release_date":"2025-12-12","title":"Sholay: The Final Cut","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[18],"id":1594854,"original_language":"en","original_title":"What's Wrong with the Net?","overview":"Outdoor Enthusiast, Content with his life is suddenly unplugged from his ‘Reality’","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ctiKHbTaFasQFSINjbqHsb7bCQX.jpg","release_date":"2025-12-12","title":"What's Wrong with the Net?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[35,18],"id":1594853,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Get the Shot","overview":"The Pressure is on for Tracy, as she’s got the hardest job on set; Dealing with an Explosive Director.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"release_date":"2025-12-10","title":"Get the Shot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/xS1TLAsRXiZJRH9zrIqDuNf1hvz.jpg","genre_ids":[27],"id":1594840,"original_language":"en","original_title":"The Harmony Files","overview":"When fear becomes peace and choice becomes myth, one recording tries to remember what humanity used to be.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/2D2f62T3xP8L7yrV0Zd7zi3lJPl.jpg","release_date":"2025-12-12","title":"The Harmony Files","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[35],"id":1594831,"original_language":"pt","original_title":"C.L.I.C.H.E.","overview":"The quirks of three UFSCar students are analyzed by a Psychology freshman, determined to 'fix them' through the filming of a docu-reality show.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"release_date":"2025-12-12","title":"C.L.I.C.H.E.","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/IcGLjHCSYnTYdgYpiFS32dNpgk.jpg","genre_ids":[18,37],"id":1588912,"original_language":"es","original_title":"Anoche en las trincheras","overview":"Mexico, 1940's.
