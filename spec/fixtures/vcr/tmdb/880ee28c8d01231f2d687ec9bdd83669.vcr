Days later, an elderly man named Sheng-Bo mysteriously disappears. A local temple deity declares that he may have blocked a wandering soul’s path to reincarnation—and has been taken by a ghost. What begins as an act of kindness spirals into fear, accusation, and superstition. As rumors multiply and blame shifts from one person to another, the community slowly confronts an unsettling truth: sometimes, there is no one to blame. When facts fail us, what do we choose to believe—and why? With dark humor and quiet spiritual tension, the film explores faith, folklore, and the stories people create to make sense of the unknown.","popularity":0.7753,"poster_path":"/rDJAivgza2jkbJ0nkoYM3PJkT44.jpg","release_date":"2025-12-16","title":"To Set a Spirit Free","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[16],"id":878246,"original_language":"hr","original_title":"Skriveni talent","overview":"It will take a lot more than a lack of talent to stop an ambitious kitten’s dream of joining in the songs of Feline City.","popularity":0.7691,"poster_path":"/iEaygsCcaGsfH0vH4t2cbzVAKYd.jpg","release_date":"2014-02-02","title":"Hidden Talent","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[35,14],"id":1257417,"original_language":"ms","original_title":"Duyung: Legenda Aurora","overview":"","popularity":0.7679,"poster_path":null,"release_date":"2025-12-25","title":"Duyung: Legenda Aurora","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/9Ey5VHkCLq8AvUVVs1Eh2VP0QtR.jpg","genre_ids":[16,10751,12,14],"id":1455670,"original_language":"no","original_title":"Reisen mot Nord","overview":"Young Gerda sets off into the great unknown in search of her friend Kai, who has mysteriously vanished.","popularity":0.7648,"poster_path":"/akYGbtcdLY5jrdZjO622bsF10wl.jpg","release_date":"2025-11-07","title":"North","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[10749],"id":1547927,"original_language":"en","original_title":"A Make or Break Holiday","overview":"Despite recently going on a break, couple Liv and Daniel had planned to host their families together for Christmas.
