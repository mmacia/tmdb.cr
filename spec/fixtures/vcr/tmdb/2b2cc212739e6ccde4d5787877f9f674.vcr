I don't think it is Michael Biehn's fault, but Kyle Reese is kind of a forgettable character in this.\r\n\r\nThe depth of this action movie is just on the concept of time travel, and whether or not you can truly change the future.\r\n\r\nThis is a good movie, but it lacks something really special for the time of 2020, it's more important as a precursor to the sequel.","created_at":"2020-07-29T01:19:00.568Z","iso_639_1":"en","media_id":218,"media_title":"The Terminator","media_type":"movie","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:41.671Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5f20ce845b2f4700364b2000"}
