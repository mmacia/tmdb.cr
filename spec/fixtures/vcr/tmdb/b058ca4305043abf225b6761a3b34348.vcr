Days later, an elderly man named Sheng-Bo mysteriously disappears. A local temple deity declares that he may have blocked a wandering soul’s path to reincarnation—and has been taken by a ghost. What begins as an act of kindness spirals into fear, accusation, and superstition. As rumors multiply and blame shifts from one person to another, the community slowly confronts an unsettling truth: sometimes, there is no one to blame. When facts fail us, what do we choose to believe—and why? With dark humor and quiet spiritual tension, the film explores faith, folklore, and the stories people create to make sense of the unknown.","popularity":0.7753,"poster_path":"/rDJAivgza2jkbJ0nkoYM3PJkT44.jpg","release_date":"2025-12-16","title":"To Set a Spirit Free","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/eDXviWshlrhrUskquIREBtFEm8C.jpg","genre_ids":[28,18],"id":1151083,"original_language":"ml","original_title":"Vrusshabha","overview":"What happens if two sworn enemies from a previous life are reborn as father-son in a new birth?","popularity":0.8328,"poster_path":"/hRKxGHeQBdwKswKgkmDrrMCDqoQ.jpg","release_date":"2025-12-25","title":"Vrusshabha","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[14,10751],"id":1549037,"original_language":"sk","original_title":"Najväčší zázrak","overview":"","popularity":0.8191,"poster_path":null,"release_date":"2025-12-24","title":"Najväčší zázrak","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/cGVgsM30hIvArB7UUAS1KlTedNL.jpg","genre_ids":[28,12,16,35,10751,9648],"id":1488195,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Chrome Alone 2- Lost in New Jersey","overview":"When a mysterious toy company seeks to profit off the turtles' new hero status, the brothers follow the clues to New Jersey and make a shocking discovery in this all new original short.","popularity":0.8821,"poster_path":"/bnixD5ZnPGbyy0YSmeYw7D5nKlg.jpg","release_date":"2025-12-19","title":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Chrome Alone 2- Lost in New Jersey","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/3FNQ8ne5HdZQTpyQ2A57KXoZoAj.jpg","genre_ids":[10749,10770,35],"id":1547925,"original_language":"en","original_title":"A Suite Holiday Romance","overview":"During Christmas week, Sabrina Post jumps at the opportunity to ghostwrite a memoir for a famous art dealer at the iconic Grand Fairbanks Hotel in New York City.
