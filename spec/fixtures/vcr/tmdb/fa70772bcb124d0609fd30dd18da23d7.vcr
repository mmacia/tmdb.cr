Aired live on the PBS program Live from Lincoln Center, on June 24, 1987, the Karamazovs are joined by such \"new vaudeville\" acts as Avner the Eccentric and members of the troupe Vaudeville Nouveau. The five members of the Karamazovs all play major roles: Patterson and Magid as the twins Antipholus, Nelson and Williams as the twins Dromio, and Furst as William Shakespeare himself. Their modern farcical take on the play manages to incorporate everything from juggling, acrobatics and faux knife-throwing to gospel, jazz and a cross-dressing brothel madam. Many jokes make reference to American culture of the 1980s. One running gag is that nobody can pronounce \"Epidamnum,\" a place mentioned several times over the course of the play. After each stammering attempt, all onstage actors stop, point toward the supposed location, then resume their activities.","poster_path":null,"media_type":"movie","original_language":"en","genre_ids":[],"popularity":0.0071,"release_date":"1987-06-24","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"id":198442,"title":"Anna Karamazoff","original_title":"Anna Karamazoff","overview":"This film is of interest primarily because it contains within it the entire surviving footage of an unfinished 1974 film by the same director, Slave of Love, which was successfully remade shortly thereafter by another director, Nikita Mikhalkov.The \"cover\" story is about a woman (Jeanne Moreau) newly released from prison camps in the 1940s back into Russian society, who finds that there is no place for her in the world she has come back to. However, this painterly film is so filled with striking and surreal imagery that it would be misleading to say that the story is of any great importance in relation to that.","poster_path":"/sWJIQGdcFipKNKGX9pQZguUGztX.jpg","media_type":"movie","original_language":"ru","genre_ids":[878],"popularity":3.596,"release_date":"1991-05-01","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":9},{"adult":false,"id":1076198,"name":"Samuel Ross Williams","original_name":"Samuel Ross Williams","media_type":"person","popularity":0.1483,"gender":2,"known_for_department":"Acting","profile_path":null,"known_for":[{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/7Crr6NUGAhfLM2ybjcq1dtN8YUl.jpg","id":10303,"title":"The Jewel of the Nile","original_title":"The Jewel of the Nile","overview":"Joan Wilder is thrust back into a world of murder, chases, foreign intrigue... and love.
